This data set is a clinical animal study screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. In this study the performance of the drug of interest, Capomulin, was compared against existing treatment regimens.

Analysis consisted of generating mulitiple tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study.
